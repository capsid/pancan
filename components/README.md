pancan components
=================

This directory contains a number of private components needed to complete some of the CaPSID workflows.
Because these are not for public distribution, even though we are using a private repository, these
are encrypted files, and require a private key for extraction within the deployment system. The 
private key is, of course, not placed into any repositories. It's a 2048 bit RSA key pair, so 
good luck trying to get the content any other way.
